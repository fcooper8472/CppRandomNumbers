# CppRandomNumbers
Standalone examples for the Distribution Zoo

## Random samples of size n

The directory `RandomSamples` contains a standalone cpp file with a single main function for each distribution.

## Verifying the examples

The script `CompileRunTest.py` will compile each standalone executable, run them, and generate a graph comparing the
histogram to the scipy PDFs.
